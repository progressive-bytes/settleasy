                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Settleasy is designed with privacy as a core principle. All settlement and participant data you create remains stored locally on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data on our servers. We do not have access to your settlement information, participant details, or any images you add to the app.</p>

                <h2>Information We Collect and Process</h2>
                
                <h3>Data You Store Locally on Your Device</h3>
                <p>When you use Settleasy, the following data is created and stored exclusively on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Settlement Information:</strong> Names, descriptions, dates, and calculations related to your settlements</li>
                    <li><strong>Participant Information:</strong> Names and details of participants you add to settlements, including percentage shares in settlements</li>
                    <li><strong>Financial Data:</strong> Expense and income items, amounts, currencies, exchange rates, and calculated net balances</li>
                    <li><strong>Settlement Payments:</strong> Records of payments made between participants to balance settlements</li>
                    <li><strong>Images:</strong> Photos you choose to associate with participants, whether selected from your photo library, captured with your camera, or added from files</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Storage Location:</strong> All this data is stored locally on your device only. It is never transmitted to our servers, any third party, or over the internet.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Your Control:</strong> You have complete control over this data. You can modify or delete any information at any time through the App's interface. If you delete the App, all locally stored data will be removed from your device.</p>

                <h3>Data We Do Not Collect</h3>
                <p>We do not collect, process, or have access to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your name, email address, or contact information</li>
                    <li>Your settlement or financial data</li>
                    <li>Images you add to the app</li>
                    <li>Your device's location</li>
                    <li>Your contacts, calendar, or other personal information</li>
                    <li>Any personally identifiable information beyond what is described in the "Analytics Data" section below</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Device Permissions</h3>
                <p>The App requests the following permissions when you use specific features:</p>
                
                <p><strong>Photo Library Access:</strong> When you choose to add a photo from your library to a participant, the App requests permission to access your photos. We use Apple's PhotosUI framework with the photo picker, which allows you to select specific photos to share with the App. Only the photos you explicitly select are accessed and stored locally on your device. We do not have access to your entire photo library.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Camera Access:</strong> When you choose to take a new photo for a participant, the App requests permission to access your camera. Photos taken are stored locally on your device only. We do not have access to your camera except when you actively use this feature.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Files Access:</strong> When you choose to add an image from files, the App requests permission to access the specific file you select. Files are accessed only when you explicitly select them and are stored locally on your device only.</p>
                
                <p>The App does not request or use location services, microphone access (beyond camera when taking photos), contacts, calendar, Bluetooth, or any other device permissions beyond those listed above.</p>

                <h3>Analytics Data</h3>
                <p>We use App Store Connect Analytics provided by Apple to understand how the App is used and to improve it. This service may collect limited, anonymized usage data, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>App launches and session duration</li>
                    <li>Device type and operating system version</li>
                    <li>App crashes and performance data</li>
                    <li>General feature usage (which screens are viewed)</li>
                    <li>Country or region (based on App Store account)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> This analytics data is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Collected and processed by Apple, not by us directly</li>
                    <li>Aggregated and anonymized (not linked to your identity)</li>
                    <li>Not combined with your settlement data, which remains local on your device</li>
                    <li>Subject to Apple's privacy policy</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>You can control whether analytics data is shared with app developers in your device's Settings > Privacy & Security > Analytics & Improvements > Share [Device] Analytics. If you disable this setting, no analytics data will be collected.</p>
                
                <p>We do not use any third-party analytics services beyond App Store Connect Analytics. We do not have any analytics on our companion website or any other platforms.</p>

                <h3>Purchase Information</h3>
                <p>Settleasy offers a one-time in-app purchase to unlock premium features ("Settleasy Pro"). This purchase is processed entirely through Apple's StoreKit framework. We do not collect, process, or store any payment information, credit card details, or billing addresses.</p>
                
                <p>Apple processes the transaction according to their privacy policy (available at <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/</a>). We receive only the minimum information necessary to verify your purchase and provide you with the Pro features you purchased. This verification happens locally on your device and does not involve transmitting your personal information to our servers.</p>

                <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
                <p><strong>Local Data Processing:</strong> Your settlement and participant data is processed locally on your device solely to provide the App's functionality (calculations, tracking, balance settlements, display of information). We do not have access to this data.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Analytics Data:</strong> Aggregated, anonymized analytics data collected through App Store Connect is used solely to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Understand how the App is being used</li>
                    <li>Identify and fix crashes or bugs</li>
                    <li>Improve app performance and user experience</li>
                    <li>Make informed decisions about future features</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)</h2>
                <p>For users in the European Economic Area (EEA), our legal bases for processing are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Legitimate Interest:</strong> We have a legitimate interest in using anonymized analytics to improve the App's functionality and user experience, which does not override your privacy rights</li>
                    <li><strong>Contract Performance:</strong> Processing necessary to provide the App's services to you</li>
                    <li><strong>Consent:</strong> Where required by law, such as for accessing your photos, camera, or files (you provide consent through iOS permission dialogs)</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
                <p>We do not share, sell, rent, or disclose any of your personal data to third parties because we do not collect or have access to your settlement data, images, or personal information.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Apple:</strong> As the App is distributed through the Apple App Store and uses Apple's services:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Apple may collect app usage analytics and crash reports as described above (subject to your device settings)</li>
                    <li>Apple processes in-app purchases according to their privacy policy</li>
                    <li>Your use of Apple services is subject to Apple's Privacy Policy at <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/</a></li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law, court order, or governmental authority, but given that we do not collect or store your data on our servers, we would have no data to disclose.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
                <p>Because all your settlement and participant data is stored locally on your device, there are no international data transfers of this data. Your data remains in your possession and under your control at all times.</p>
                
                <p>Analytics data collected through App Store Connect may be transferred to and processed by Apple in the United States and other countries where Apple operates. These transfers are governed by Apple's privacy policy and appropriate safeguards.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Data Retention</h2>
                <p><strong>Local Data:</strong> Data is retained on your device for as long as you choose to keep it. You may delete individual settlements, participants, items, or photos at any time through the App. Uninstalling the App will remove all locally stored data from your device.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Analytics Data:</strong> Aggregated analytics data is retained by Apple according to their data retention policies.</p>

                <h2>Your Rights Under GDPR</h2>
                <p>If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), you have the following rights:</p>
                
                <h3>Regarding Local Data Stored on Your Device:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Right of Access:</strong> You have full access to all data stored by the App on your device at all times through the App's interface</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> You can modify any data through the App's interface</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Erasure:</strong> You can delete any data through the App's interface or by uninstalling the App</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Restriction of Processing:</strong> You control all processing by choosing what data to enter and when to use the App</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> Your data is stored locally on your device</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Object:</strong> You have complete control over what data is created and processed</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Withdraw Consent:</strong> You may revoke camera, photo library, or file access permissions in your device's Settings > Settleasy, and you may stop using the App at any time</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Regarding Analytics Data:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can opt out of analytics collection through your device's Settings > Privacy & Security > Analytics & Improvements</li>
                    <li>You may contact us at contact@progressive-bytes.com if you have questions about analytics data</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Since we do not collect or process your settlement data on our servers, exercising most rights related to that data does not require contacting us. However, if you have questions, concerns, or wish to exercise your rights, you may contact us at contact@progressive-bytes.com.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Right to Lodge a Complaint:</strong> You have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection supervisory authority if you believe your data protection rights have been violated.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Your Rights Under CCPA (California Residents)</h2>
                <p>If you are a California resident, the CCPA provides you with specific rights:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Right to Know:</strong> We do not collect personal information beyond the anonymized analytics described above</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Delete:</strong> You can delete local data through the App, and opt out of analytics through device settings</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Opt-Out of Sale:</strong> We do not sell your personal information</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Non-Discrimination:</strong> We do not discriminate against users who exercise their privacy rights</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Because your settlement data remains on your device and we only collect minimal anonymized analytics, the CCPA's disclosure and deletion rights are largely fulfilled by the App's privacy-first design.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Security</h2>
                <p>We take the security of your data seriously. Your settlement and participant data is stored locally on your device using Apple's secure SwiftData framework, which benefits from your device's built-in security features:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data encryption at rest (enabled by default on modern iOS devices)</li>
                    <li>Device authentication protection (passcode, Face ID, Touch ID)</li>
                    <li>iOS security architecture and sandboxing</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>We recommend:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keeping your device's operating system up to date</li>
                    <li>Using a strong device passcode</li>
                    <li>Being cautious about granting device access to others</li>
                    <li>Keeping your device physically secure</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Since we do not store your data on servers, it is not vulnerable to server-side data breaches.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>Settleasy is rated appropriate for ages 4 and older and may be used by children. We take children's privacy seriously and comply with applicable children's privacy laws, including COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) in the United States and Article 8 of GDPR in the EU.</p>
                
                <p><strong>No Data Collection from Children:</strong> We do not knowingly collect personal information from children through our App. All data entered into the App is stored locally on the device and is not transmitted to us or any third party.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Parental Controls:</strong> Since the App stores data only locally and does not require an account or internet connection, parents and guardians should supervise their children's use of the App as they would with any device application. Parents can monitor what information children enter into the App by accessing the device.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Analytics:</strong> The anonymized analytics collected through App Store Connect is aggregated and not linked to any individual, including children. Parents can disable analytics sharing in their device settings.</p>
                
                <p>If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided information through the App, please note that all such information is stored only on your device and can be deleted by deleting the App or specific data within it.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p>The App does not integrate with or use any third-party analytics, advertising, tracking, or social media services, with the following exceptions:</p>
                
                <p><strong>Apple Services:</strong></p>

                </ul>
                
                <p>These Apple services are governed by Apple's Privacy Policy, available at <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/</a>.</p>

                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the App, legal requirements, or our practices. When we make changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.</p>

                <h2>No Internet Connection Required</h2>
                <p>Settleasy functions entirely offline. No internet connection is required to use any of the App's core features, including creating settlements, managing participants, recording expenses, and calculating balances. Your data is never transmitted over the internet through our App.</p>
                
                <p>The only internet-related functionality is:</p>

                <p><strong>Device Backups:</strong> If you have iCloud Backup or iTunes/Finder backup enabled in your device settings, your device may back up the App's locally stored data (including settlements, participants, and images) to your personal iCloud account or computer as part of your device's automatic backup. This is controlled by your device's backup settings and is governed by Apple's privacy policy.</p>
