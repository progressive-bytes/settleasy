                <h2>Smart Settlement Calculations</h2>
                <p>Create a settlement, add your expenses and income, and let Settleasy do the math:</p>
                
                <h3>Flexible Shares</h3>
                <p>Set how costs are divided: equal splits, custom percentages, or specific amounts. One participant paying 70%? Another 30%? Done.</p>
                
                <h3>Track Who Paid What</h3>
                <p>Record actual payments for each expense. Alice paid $50, Bob paid $150 for a $200 dinner? Add both contributions and the app tracks the balance automatically.</p>
                
                <h3>Automatic Balance Calculation</h3>
                <p>Instantly see who owes whom based on agreed shares versus actual payments. No mental math, no tab arguments.</p>
                
                <h3>Settlement Payments</h3>
                <p>Record payments between participants to clear balances. Watch debts zero out as you settle up.</p>

                <h2>Built for Real Life</h2>
                
                <h3>Multi-Currency Made Easy</h3>
                <p>Traveling abroad? Set your settlement in USD while adding expenses in EUR, JPY, or any currency. Enter exchange rates to convert paid amounts to your base ledger currency.</p>
                
                <h3>Income & Expenses Together</h3>
                <p>Received a group refund or shared income? Add it to the same settlement. Settleasy properly factors income into your budget calculations.</p>
                
                <h3>Duplicate Settlements Instantly</h3>
                <p>Monthly household expenses? Long-press any settlement to duplicate it with your choice of items, shares, and payments carried over. No recreating from scratch.</p>
                
                <h3>Split With Precision</h3>
                <p>Multiple split methods via long-press menus including split equally, by shares, or by specific percentages (10%, 20%, 50%).</p>
